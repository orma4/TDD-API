# TDD & API Project

# Jewish Calendar/Converter

## Description:
The API I chose is the Hebrew calendar API which divides into 2 sub apiâ€™s- Jewish calendar REST API and Hebrew Date Converter REST API.
In my project app I implemented the features:
 1. Check jewish fasting on specific dates
 2. Convert Jewish date to Georgian date
 3. Check all events in a specific dates

Using the tdd development I performed all the 10 tests successfully and developed a fully working code for the API features chosen.

The project's CI platform automatically begin running all tests and linting configurations with fully CICD principles implemented, then deploying the app to Heroku cloud server after the CI services passes all the tests.
